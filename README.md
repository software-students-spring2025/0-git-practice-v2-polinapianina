Hello everyone! Here's the article that I have picked for this exercise: 

[How to tell what level of developer you are, junior to senior](https://jg.gg/2020/11/22/how-to-tell-what-level-of-developer-you-are/?source=post_page-----56b0d9de2c43--------------------------------)

As a senior in college preparing to enter the workforce, I found Jackson Gabbard's article insightful, for I think it's precectly clear at separating these three levels of developers. The idea that career progression in tech is *meritocratic* resonates with me, particularly as it contrasts with the rigid hierarchies seen in other industries, according to the author of the article. The emphasis on continual learning and skill-building, rather than years of experience, is both motivating and reassuring as I prepare to begin my career.

## Comment from yours truly (Jahleel)
- Similar to what Polina has already stated, I did find it really interesting to get a more in-depth explanation about where I am at. I already considered myself to be at best a junior developer, but the explanation that the author gave actually gave me a modicum of confidence in my current capabilities. I also was not particularly aware of mid-level developers (though maybe that was just the roles without any seniority-related prefixes), so it was interesting to see the bridge between junior and senior devs thoroughly explained as well. The article also gave me a bit of hope about my future in software engineering and adjacent job titles because I have such a great appreciation for learning and applying new skills.
